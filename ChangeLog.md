MochiPHP ChangeLog
==================

0.2 - 2011-05-29
----------------

* Added a sample application: Simple Blog (`/blog/index`)
* Removed all the php\_value entries from .htaccess so that it can be run on hosting servers that don't support for php\_value
* Removed "php\_value include\_path" from .htaccess to be more portable, thus no longer needed to modify .htaccess on Windows.
